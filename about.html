    <p>Henry Lewek is a first year student at the <strong>University of Hartford</strong> and persuing a degree in Human Computer Interaction Design &#40;HCID&#41;. Coming from a small town in Bedford, NH, he has a big passion for everything and anything technology related. He has a 21 year old cat named Jasper who matches his fur with Henry's hair. He drives a Mini Cooper which is a manual car. Some of Henry's favorite hobbies are listening to music, keeping up to date with technology, and being social.</p>
    <p>Choosing to go to the University of Hartford was an easy choice for him. It was the second college his visited, and fell in love with it instantly. Henry is a big fan of all four seasons so staying in New England was a must for him. Plus with it only being roughly 2 hours away from New Hampshire, and the fantastic campus/opportunities that the college presents, UHART was the perfect fit.</p>
